As a test task for Crowde QA position we ask our candidates to write automated E2E test cases for our marketplace view.
You are free to choose your stack and technologies. 

At Crowde our services are built using Go and our UI stack is built on ReactJS. We run our software in containers on Kubernetes and make heavy use of Jenkins for our CI/CD needs. For E2E testing we have experience using Cypress.

Guidelines:
- Scope and granularity of the test is up to you â€” we are more interested in your thought process around your choices rather than broad coverage.
- Choose the most suitable testing stack for the job.
- Test flow should be CI ready or have an implementation plan for it.
- Write rationale for major stack and implementation choices.
